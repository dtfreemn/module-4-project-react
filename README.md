#### [Trip Tracker Backend Repository - Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/dtfreemn/module-4-project-rails)

### Overview
  Trip Tracker is a trip planning web application that uses the free version of the Yelp API. With Trip Tracker, users can trips and select and save activities, restaurants, attractions, nightlife, etc. All cities that Yelp serves are included on the app. After users create a trip and set the dates and the budget, the application hits the Yelp API and displays popular activities for the chosen location. Users can also filter the API hit for various categories. Once activities have been displayed, users can save their favorites and keep track of the places they want to go and the things they want to do on their trip.
